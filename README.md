# IIITA Health Center Doctor Appointment Booking System

A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack to streamline doctor appointment scheduling for the Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad (IIITA) Health Center. Students can register, log in, book and manage appointments with on-campus doctors, while admins and doctors oversee schedules, patient data, and health center operations.

This project provides a scalable and secure platform for managing doctor appointments at the IIITA Health Center. Key features include user authentication, appointment booking with slot availability, online payment integration via Razorpay, and role-based dashboards for patients, admins, and doctors. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the application emphasizes responsive design, secure data handling, and a modern UI tailored for a college health center.
